## 🛠️ What to Build

### 🔐 Authentication
- Email/password register & login
- Protected routes — dashboard accessible only after login
- User profile with avatar upload
- Logout and token refresh

### 🏢 Workspaces
- Create and switch between multiple workspaces
- Invite members by email; assign roles (Admin / Member)
- Each workspace has a name, description, and accent colour

### 🎯 Goals & Milestones
- Create goals with title, owner, due date, and status
- Nest milestones under goals with a progress percentage
- Post progress updates on a goal's activity feed

### 📢 Announcements
- Admins publish rich-text announcements workspace-wide
- Team members can react (emoji) and comment
- Pin important announcements to the top of the feed

### ✅ Action Items
- Create action items with assignee, priority, due date, and status
- Link action items to a parent goal
- Kanban board and list view toggle

### ⚡ Real-time & Activity
- Socket.io pushes new posts, reactions, and status changes live
- Show which members are currently online in the workspace
- `@Mention` teammates in comments — triggers an in-app notification

### 📊 Analytics
- Dashboard stats: total goals, items completed this week, overdue count
- Goal completion chart (Recharts)
- Export workspace data as CSV

## 🌟 Advanced Features (All Implemented)
1. **Real-time collaborative editing:** Multiple users edit a goal description simultaneously with live cursors
2. **Optimistic UI:** Actions reflect instantly before server confirmation; roll back gracefully on error
3. **Offline support:** Cache data locally; queue writes while offline and sync on reconnect
4. **Advanced RBAC:** Permission matrix controlling who can create goals, post announcements, and invite members
5. **Audit log:** Immutable log of all workspace changes; filterable timeline UI with CSV export

## 🌟 Bonus Features (Extra Credit)
- **Dark / light theme:** System preference detection
- **Email notifications:** Invitations and @mention emails via Nodemailer or EmailJS
- **Keyboard shortcuts:** `Cmd+K` command palette for navigation
- **Unit & integration tests:** Jest + Supertest (backend), React Testing Library (frontend)
- **OpenAPI / Swagger docs:** Served at `/api/docs`
- **PWA:** Installable on mobile with offline shell
